ambarella/oryx/services:
  this directory includes the instantiation of the oryx classes.
  Each service/server is a process, and child process of service_manager.
  service_manager spawns the services and wait for the services to register,
  and service_manager call init process of the services in a pre-defined order.

  After init done, service_manager does not exit, instead, it monitors the child
  processes and acts as watchdog.

  When exiting, service_manager will be responsible for stopping the services in
  required order (if needed).

  "base" is the base class of all services/server, because they all look similar.
  Any other types of services derive from "AMServiceBase".
