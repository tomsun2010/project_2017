/* Note:
 * 1. SIZE_IDSP_CFG_ADV_ISO corresponds to the total size of the idsp config

 * 2. SIZE_LISO_CFG_ADV_ISO corresponds to the size of a12_low_iso_param_t structure
 * 3. COLOR_UPDATE_FLAG_OFFSET represents the relative offset of
 *    a12_low_iso_param_t.color.update_all to the beginning of the structure
 *    a12_low_iso_param_t
 * 4. user can store user specified data beginning from FASTBOOT_USER_DATA_OFFSET
 *    but size must NOT exceed 3 KB. see FBDATA layout in amba_arch_mem.h
