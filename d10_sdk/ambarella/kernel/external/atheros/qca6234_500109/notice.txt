 * HLR/AuC testing gateway for hostapd EAP-SIM/AKA database/authenticator
 * Copyright (c) 2005-2007, Jouni Malinen <j@w1.fi>
 *
 * This software may be distributed under the terms of the BSD license.
 * See README for more details.
 *
 * This is an example implementation of the EAP-SIM/AKA database/authentication
 * gateway interface to HLR/AuC. It is expected to be replaced with an
 * implementation of SS7 gateway to GSM/UMTS authentication center (HLR/AuC) or
 * a local implementation of SIM triplet and AKA authentication data generator.
 *
 * hostapd will send SIM/AKA authentication queries over a UNIX domain socket
 * to and external program, e.g., this hlr_auc_gw. This interface uses simple
 * text-based format:
 *
 * EAP-SIM / GSM triplet query/response:
 * SIM-REQ-AUTH <IMSI> <max_chal>
 * SIM-RESP-AUTH <IMSI> Kc1:SRES1:RAND1 Kc2:SRES2:RAND2 [Kc3:SRES3:RAND3]
 * SIM-RESP-AUTH <IMSI> FAILURE
 *
 * EAP-AKA / UMTS query/response:
 * AKA-REQ-AUTH <IMSI>
 * AKA-RESP-AUTH <IMSI> <RAND> <AUTN> <IK> <CK> <RES>
 * AKA-RESP-AUTH <IMSI> FAILURE
 *
 * EAP-AKA / UMTS AUTS (re-synchronization):
 * AKA-AUTS <IMSI> <AUTS> <RAND>
 *
 * IMSI and max_chal are sent as an ASCII string,
 * Kc/SRES/RAND/AUTN/IK/CK/RES/AUTS as hex strings.
 *
 * The example implementation here reads GSM authentication triplets from a
 * text file in IMSI:Kc:SRES:RAND format, IMSI in ASCII, other fields as hex
 * strings. This is used to simulate an HLR/AuC. As such, it is not very useful
 * for real life authentication, but it is useful both as an example
 * implementation and for EAP-SIM testing.

 * See README for more details.
 *
 * This l2_packet implementation is explicitly for WinPcap and Windows events.
 * l2_packet_pcap.c has support for WinPcap, but it requires polling to receive
 * frames which means relatively long latency for EAPOL RX processing. The
 * implementation here uses a separate thread to allow WinPcap to be receiving
 * all the time to reduce latency for EAPOL receiving from about 100 ms to 3 ms
 * when comparing l2_packet_pcap.c to l2_packet_winpcap.c. Extra sleep of 50 ms
 * is added in to receive thread whenever no EAPOL frames has been received for
 * a while. Whenever an EAPOL handshake is expected, this sleep is removed.
 *
 * The RX thread receives a frame and signals main thread through Windows event
 * about the availability of a new frame. Processing the received frame is
 * synchronized with pair of Windows events so that no extra buffer or queuing
 * mechanism is needed. This implementation requires Windows specific event
 * loop implementation, i.e., eloop_win.c.
 *
 * WinPcap has pcap_getevent() that could, in theory at least, be used to
 * implement this kind of waiting with a simpler single-thread design. However,
 * that event handle is not really signaled immediately when receiving each
 * frame, so it does not really work for this kind of use.

 * httpread - Manage reading file(s) from HTTP/TCP socket
 * Author: Ted Merrill

 * See README for more details.
 *
 * The files are buffered via internal callbacks from eloop, then presented to
 * an application callback routine when completely read into memory. May also
 * be used if no file is expected but just to get the header, including HTTP
 * replies (e.g. HTTP/1.1 200 OK etc.).
 *
 * This does not attempt to be an optimally efficient implementation, but does
 * attempt to be of reasonably small size and memory consumption; assuming that
 * only small files are to be read. A maximum file size is provided by
 * application and enforced.
 *
 * It is assumed that the application does not expect any of the following:
 * -- transfer encoding other than chunked
 * -- trailer fields
 * It is assumed that, even if the other side requested that the connection be
 * kept open, that we will close it (thus HTTP messages sent by application
 * should have the connection closed field); this is allowed by HTTP/1.1 and
 * simplifies things for us.
 *
 * Other limitations:
 * -- HTTP header may not exceed a hard-coded size.
 *
 * Notes:
 * This code would be massively simpler without some of the new features of
 * HTTP/1.1, especially chunked data.
